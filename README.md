# C
Every program I've made so far in my C Journey in chronological order. ðŸ¤ž

Computer Programming is a medium for us to communicate with computers. Programming is a way for us to deliver our instructions to the computer.

C is a programming Language. C is one of the oldest and finest programming languag. C was developed by Dennis Ritchie at AT&T's Bell Labs, USA in 1972.

Uses of C ---> C is used to program a wide variety of systems. Some of the uses of C are as follows:

* Major parts of Windows, Linux and other operating system are written in C.
* C is used to write driver programs for devices like Tablets, Printers etc.
* C Language is used to program embedded systems where programs need to run faster in limited memory. (Microwave, Cameras etc)
* Basic Structure of a C Progrm:- All C programs have to follow a basic structure. A C program starts with a main function and executes instructions present inside it. Each instruction is terminated with a semicolon (;).

There are some rules which are applicable to all the C Programs.

1. Every program execution starts from main() function.
2. All the statements are terminated with a semicolon.
3. Instructions are case-sensitive.
4. Instructions are executed in the same order in which they are written.

Important Notes:-

a. We can use switch-case statements even by writing cases in any order of our choice (not necessarily ascending).
b. Char values are allowed as they can be easily evaluated to any inetger.
c. A Switch can occur within another but in practice this is rarely done.
d. Sometimes the name of the variable might not indicate the behaviour of the program.
e. Break statement completely exits the loop.
f. Continue statements skip the particular iteration of the loop.
g. Recursion is sometimes the most direct way to code an algorithm.
h. The condition which doesn't call the function any further in a recursive function is called as the base condition.
i. Sometimes, due to a mistake made by the programmers a recursive function can keep running without returning resulting in a memory error.
j. It is very important to note that the array index starts with 0.
k. The string should be short enough to fit into the array.
l. Scanf cannot be used to input multi-word strings with spaces.
m. Once a string is defined using char st[]="abc", it cannot be reinitialized to something else.
n. A string defined using pointers can be reinitialized ptr="abc";
